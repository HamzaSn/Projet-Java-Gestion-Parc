- the main difference between HashSet And ArrayList is that array list
  maintain the order of the elements.

- ArrayList allows duplicates items in collection, where hashSet only allow unique values

- HashSet does not have get(index)

- to access HashSet elements in a loop we have a couple of methods :

-  for(Type elem : HashSet){
        elem.

        // note that you cannot modify or remove elements when iterating ( CocurrentModification of Collection )
}

- Iterator

   Iterator it = HashSet.Iterator()
   while(it.hasNext() ){
    elem =  it.next();
    then you can access hashSet Methods by elem.method()
   }
